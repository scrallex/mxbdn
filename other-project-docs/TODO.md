This is a fantastic and incredibly detailed project breakdown. It's a complex system, and the documentation is very thorough. I've analyzed the linker errors in conjunction with your architecture documents, file listings, and source code.

The build failure is caused by a combination of incorrect linker flags, missing dependency paths for third-party libraries, and unlinked transitive dependencies from your static libraries. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues and how to fix them.

### Diagnosis of the Linker Errors

**1. Primary Issue: Incorrect Library Naming in `target_link_libraries`**

The linker error `cannot find -llibcycles_session` is the most telling clue. The `-l` flag tells the linker to find a library. It automatically prepends `lib` and appends `.a` (for static) or `.so` (for shared).

Your build system is likely doing this: `-l` + `libcycles_session` = search for `liblibcycles_session.a`.

This is a common mistake in a `CMakeLists.txt` file. You are probably linking the libraries by their full filename (`libcycles_session`) instead of their logical name (`cycles_session`).

**2. Secondary Issue: Missing Library Search Paths**

The errors `cannot find -lOpenVDB` and `cannot find -lOpenSubdiv` indicate that the linker doesn't know *where* to find these libraries. Your `README.md` correctly notes that `scripts/setup_cycles_env.sh` is required to set up the environment variables. This strongly suggests that either:
a. The environment was not set up before running `cmake`.
b. The `CMakeLists.txt` file is not correctly using these environment variables to tell the linker where to find the libraries (e.g., using `link_directories()` or setting `IMPORTED` library target properties).

**3. Tertiary Issue: Missing Transitive Dependencies (OSL)**

Your `ARCHITECTURE.md` diagram correctly identifies this. The static Cycles libraries (`libcycles_kernel.a`, etc.) depend on the OpenShadingLanguage (OSL) shared libraries (`.so`). When you link a static library into your executable, the executable becomes responsible for providing all of that static library's dependencies.

The errors `undefined refs` from Cycles libraries to OSL functions confirm this. Your final `sep_engine` executable must be explicitly linked against `liboslexec.so`, `liboslcomp.so`, and `liboslquery.so`.

The diagram also flags `libcycles_osl.a` as `MISSING!`. Your `find` command shows it exists. This means it's "missing" from the link line in your CMake file. This library is the glue between Cycles and OSL and is critical.

### Latent Bugs (Not Causing This Error, But Will Cause the Next One)

Your architecture diagram also reveals two other problems that you should fix while you're at it:

*   **Symbol Conflicts:** The `quantum x--x memory` conflict is a time bomb. It means you have defined a function or global variable in a header file that is included by both modules. You must move the *definitions* of `manifold::memory`, `manifold::quantum`, etc., into their respective `.cpp` files, leaving only the `extern` *declarations* in the headers.
*   **Missing Implementations:** `createQuantumProcessor` and `shutdownLogging` are missing.
    *   `createQuantumProcessor` is likely a factory function. I see you call `sep::quantum::createQuantumProcessor({})` in `sep_engine.cpp`, but the function itself is probably missing or wrapped in an `#ifdef` that is not being met.
    *   `shutdownLogging` is called from `main.cpp` but is likely missing its definition in `logging.cpp`.

### Actionable Plan to Fix the Build

Here is a step-by-step guide to resolve the build failure.

**Step 1: Clean Your Build Environment**

Before making changes, start fresh to ensure no old cached variables are causing issues.

```bash
cd /sep
rm -rf cmake-make # Or your build directory
mkdir cmake-make
cd cmake-make
```

**Step 2: Ensure Environment Variables are Set**

Source the setup script in your current shell before running CMake. This will provide the paths for OSL, OpenVDB, etc.

```bash
# In your /sep directory
source scripts/setup_cycles_env.sh
```

**Step 3: Correct Your `CMakeLists.txt`**

Find the `CMakeLists.txt` file that defines the `sep_engine` target (likely `src/CMakeLists.txt` or the top-level one). Locate the `target_link_libraries(sep_engine ...)` command and make the following changes.

**A. Fix Library Names:**
Remove the `lib` prefix from all your SEP and Cycles libraries.

**B. Add Missing Cycles & OSL Libraries:**
Ensure `cycles_osl` is on the link line. Add the OSL libraries. The linker needs to know where to find them, which the environment variables from the script should help with.

**C. Add Third-Party Library Paths:**
Tell CMake where to find OpenVDB and OpenSubdiv. You can use `link_directories()` or `find_library()` to get the full paths.

Here is an example of what the corrected command might look like:

```cmake
# In your CMakeLists.txt

# Make sure CMake finds the libraries from your setup script
# The script should set e.g., OSL_ROOT_DIR, OPENVDB_ROOT_DIR
find_package(OpenShadingLanguage REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenVDB REQUIRED)
# ... find other packages

target_link_libraries(sep_engine PRIVATE
    # --- Your Static Libraries (Correct logical names) ---
    sep_api
    sep_blender
    sep_audio
    sep_quantum
    sep_memory
    sep_compat
    sep_core

    # --- Cycles Libraries (Correct logical names) ---
    cycles_kernel
    cycles_scene
    cycles_device
    cycles_osl      # <-- CRITICAL: This was likely missing
    cycles_graph
    cycles_subd
    cycles_bvh
    cycles_util
    cycles_integrator
    
    # --- OSL and other dependencies (Transitive deps of Cycles) ---
    # CMake's find_package should create imported targets like OSL::oslexec
    OSL::oslexec
    OSL::oslcomp
    OSL::oslquery
    OpenVDB::openvdb
    # ... other dependencies like OpenImageIO, TBB, etc.

    # --- System Libraries ---
    pthread
    hiredis
    pipewire-0.3
    ${CUDA_LIBRARIES}
)
```

**Step 4: Re-run CMake and Build**

From your clean `cmake-make` directory (and with the environment script sourced):

```bash
# You are in /sep/cmake-make
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

This should resolve the "cannot find" linker errors.

**Step 5: Address the Latent Bugs**

Once the linking succeeds, you should address the other issues:

1.  **Multiple Definitions:** Search your codebase for definitions of `manifold::memory` and other conflicting symbols in header files. Move their function bodies to a `.cpp` file, leaving only the declaration in the header.
2.  **Missing `createQuantumProcessor`:** Check `src/quantum/processor.cpp`. The factory function `createQuantumProcessor` is there, but its visibility might be an issue. Ensure it is not declared `static` and is being properly exported if it's in a different library. In your case, it seems `api/sep_engine.cpp` calls it, and it's defined in `quantum/quantum_processor.cpp`. Make sure `libsep_quantum.a` is correctly linked to `libsep_api.a` if the API module is what's using it. The `ARCHITECTURE.md` diagram shows `api --> quantum`, which is correct.
3.  **Missing `shutdownLogging`:** Add the function definition to `src/core/logging.cpp`:
    ```cpp
    // In src/core/logging.cpp
    #include "core/logging.h"
    #include <spdlog/spdlog.h>

    // ... existing code ...

    void shutdownLogging() {
        spdlog::shutdown();
    }
    ```
    And declare it in `include/core/logging.h`.

By following this plan, you will not only fix the immediate build-stopper but also harden your architecture against future errors.
