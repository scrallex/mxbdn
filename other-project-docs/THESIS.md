# A Recursive Framework for Emergent Reality: Reinterpreting Information, Causality, and Spacetime

## Abstract

We present an expanded formulation of Alexander J Nagy’s “Recursive Framework for Emergent Reality,” which posits that physical reality arises from a self-referential informational process. In this framework, spacetime is modeled as a Riemannian manifold encoding all possible forward paths of evolution rather than a single fixed history. Mass is reinterpreted as a displacement or distortion of underlying fields – akin to an object moving through a laminar fluid flow – giving rise to inertia and gravitation as emergent resistance effects. Quantum measurement is described as the emergence of a **local** frame of reference (a definite outcome) from a **global** quantum potential (the universal wavefunction), addressing the measurement problem by treating observation as a recursive, symmetry-breaking process. Information is identified with physical uncertainty (in the sense of Shannon entropy) and recursion is proposed as the mechanism by which coherence and order self-organize from underlying indeterminacy. We apply this perspective to cosmology by critiquing the conventional view of the Big Bang as a true singularity; instead, the origin of the universe is reframed as a phase transition in an antecedent system, avoiding physical infinities. Throughout, connections are drawn to open problems in fundamental physics – including the quantum measurement problem, the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics, and computational/emergent models of reality. We introduce the concept of a **Self-Emergent Processor (SEP)**, a recursive computational simulation platform designed to realize and test this framework. Mathematical formalisms (e.g. path integrals, information metrics) are provided to ground the claims, and relevant literature from quantum foundations, spacetime geometry, information theory, and complexity is cited to place this proposal in context. The result is a self-consistent, interdisciplinary vision of physics wherein reality’s laws and structure “bootstrap” themselves via recursive information processing.

## Introduction

Modern physics faces deep conceptual challenges at the intersection of quantum mechanics (QM), general relativity (GR), and information theory. Quantum mechanics, our most fundamental description of microscopic phenomena, is formulated in terms of wavefunctions and probabilities – it allows systems to evolve in superpositions of many possible states. Yet when we perform a measurement, we **always** observe a single definite outcome, a discrepancy known as the **quantum measurement problem**. On the other hand, general relativity describes gravitation and cosmology by positing a smooth four-dimensional spacetime manifold that is dynamically curved by mass-energy. GR is deterministic and classical, with no built-in notion of quantum superposition or information as physical entities. The mismatch between QM and GR – for instance, the incompatibility of the continuum spacetime of GR with the discrete quanta of QM – has so far prevented a complete **unification** of physics into a single framework valid at all scales. Open problems such as the nature of spacetime singularities (e.g. inside black holes or at the Big Bang), the mechanism of wavefunction collapse, and the emergence of classical reality from quantum potentialities all hint that new conceptual frameworks may be needed to reconcile these theories.

Information theory and computation have increasingly been viewed as potential keys to these puzzles. Physicist John Archibald **Wheeler** famously proposed “**It from Bit**,” the idea that physical reality (“it”) fundamentally arises from yes/no informational bits. In Wheeler’s **participatory universe** vision, each act of observation is akin to posing a yes-no question to nature, thereby **creating reality by eliciting information**. This perspective suggests that information is not just an abstract accounting of knowledge, but is as real and primal as energy or matter in constructing the cosmos. Indeed, the measure of information introduced by Shannon (1948) – **entropy** – quantitatively links information and uncertainty. Shannon’s entropy $H = -\sum\_i p\_i \log p\_i$ measures the uncertainty in a system’s state; a higher entropy means more **unpredictability** (and thus more information could be gained from learning the outcome). This has a striking parallel with physical entropy in thermodynamics and with quantum uncertainty. Such links motivate treating physics itself as an *informational* process.

Alexander J Nagy’s **recursive framework for emergent reality** builds on these converging insights by hypothesizing that **recursion** – roughly, self-reference or iterative self-composition – underlies the emergence of physical law and structure. In this expanded paper, we formalize and explore Nagy’s key proposals: that spacetime and causality can be viewed as emerging from a recursive information structure, that mass and inertia can be understood via field analogies (like laminar flow), that quantum measurement corresponds to establishing a new local frame out of a global potential, and that cosmic origins may be seen as phase transitions rather than ex nihilo singularities. Each of these ideas finds echoes in existing theories or open questions. For example, the notion of spacetime “emerging” from something deeper is actively discussed in quantum gravity research (e.g. spacetime as a condensate or **superfluid** of more fundamental entities, or as built from the entanglement structure of quantum states). The puzzle of mass generation has a well-known explanation via the Higgs field in the Standard Model, but the intuitive picture of particles “moving through a field like molasses” – while imperfect – persists as a visualization of how mass might be an emergent resistance. And in cosmology, many theorists have explored how to avoid the Big Bang singularity through models like the **Big Bounce** (a prior universe contracting and then rebounding) or other new physics in the high-energy early universe.

Our aim is to synthesize these threads with Nagy’s recursion hypothesis into a coherent academic narrative. We adopt an academic tone and structure: beginning with theoretical foundations (Section 2) and proceeding through specific aspects of the framework (Sections 3–7), before concluding with implications and future outlook (Section 8). Throughout, we introduce mathematical formalism to clarify proposals (e.g. path integrals to describe superposition of paths, information-theoretic equations, etc.), and we draw connections to established physics or well-regarded speculative ideas, providing references to the literature. For clarity, we also describe potential figures that could illustrate the concepts (e.g. diagrams of branching worldlines, field flows, or cosmic phase transitions).

In summary, this paper envisions a **recursive, information-centric paradigm** for physics. In this paradigm, the universe is akin to a self-processing computation – a **Self-Emergent Processor (SEP)** – in which bits of information recursively interact to generate the laws of physics we observe. Space, time, particles, and forces would not be fundamental, but *emergent* from the self-consistent bootstrapping of informational relationships. While speculative, this vision ties together many intriguing developments in physics and may offer fresh ways to address old questions. We now proceed to develop each facet of the framework in detail.

## 1. Spacetime as a Riemannian Manifold of All Possible Paths

**1.1 Causality in Classical and Quantum Frameworks:** In classical general relativity, spacetime $(\mathcal{M}, g\_{\mu\nu})$ is a 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold equipped with a metric tensor $g\_{\mu\nu}$ that defines distances and causal structure. Particles travel along worldlines in this manifold, with free particles following geodesics (extremal proper time paths) according to the Einstein-Lagrange principle. Causality in GR is built into the light-cone structure of the metric, and for any given event, the manifold contains all future-directed timelike or null paths (worldlines) emanating from it – these represent all classically possible trajectories a particle or signal could take given that starting event. However, in classical physics, typically only **one** specific path is realized for a given particle (determined by initial conditions and forces). The other geometrically possible paths are mere hypotheticals, not actualized.

In quantum mechanics, by contrast, the principle of superposition implies that a particle does not have a single definite trajectory. Richard Feynman’s **path integral formulation** makes this explicit by stating that the amplitude for a particle to go from point A to point B is a sum (integral) over contributions from **every possible path** connecting those points. Formally, the propagator $K(B,A)$ can be written as:

$$
K(B,A) \;=\; \int_{\text{all paths } A\to B} \exp\!\Big(\frac{i}{\hbar} S[\text{path}]\Big) \mathcal{D}[\text{path}] \,,
$$

where $S\[\text{path}] = \int L,dt$ is the action of a given path. In this picture, **all possible forward paths** through spacetime contribute to quantum evolution – even classically “absurd” zigzag or non-geodesic paths. Most paths interfere destructively, and the classical path (stationary action path) often dominates due to constructive interference, but the key conceptual point is that the spacetime structure must accommodate *multiple coexisting potential trajectories*.

**1.2 The Manifold as an Information Structure:** Nagy’s framework elevates this idea of coexisting possibilities from the quantum formalism into a fundamental principle of reality. We hypothesize that spacetime itself can be viewed as a **Riemannian information manifold** encoding *all possible* forward paths at once, in a manner that is recursive. In other words, instead of treating the manifold as a static stage on which one history unfolds, we treat it as a geometrical encoding of *all histories consistent with the underlying rules*. A useful analogy is the “block universe” view in relativity (where past, present, future all exist in a single 4D structure), but here extended to include quantum branching: the manifold might include *multiple branches or layers* for the different possible outcomes at each event. Every event in spacetime can spawn many future trajectories – conceptually like a branching tree. Rather than pick one branch, the structure includes them all, much as Feynman’s integral sums over all paths. **Figure 1** (conceptual) could illustrate this: consider a particle at an initial event (point in spacetime); from it, multiple worldlines fan out (different velocities or interactions), and then those fan out further, creating a branching web of worldlines. In a classical block universe, only one branch would be realized; in our recursive block, all branches co-exist as potentialities, with amplitudes or weights.

Mathematically, one might imagine an extended configuration space or *superspace* that contains all possible geodesics or paths. A concrete approach appears in the “sum-over-histories” formulation of quantum gravity, where one integrates not just over particle paths but over all metric geometries (histories of the universe). Our framework does not demand adopting a specific quantum gravity formalism, but it aligns with any view that spacetime geometry is *not fixed and unique*, but rather an ensemble or superposition of possibilities. Each path or history carries information (its action, phase, etc.), and the real physics results from a recursive **aggregation** of these possibilities.

**1.3 Recursion and Causality:** Where does recursion enter this picture? Recursion implies that the whole structure is defined in terms of itself, or that patterns repeat at different scales. We propose that the propagation of information along each path, and the interference or coherence between paths, is a recursive process. For example, consider a particle going from A to B via two possible routes (say path 1 and path 2). In quantum mechanics, the amplitude is $A\_1 + A\_2$; if we now regard B as a new “node” that can lead to further paths to C, then the amplitude to C would be a sum over all extended paths A->B->C, which can be grouped recursively as $(A\_1+A\_2)$ from A to B, then interfering with paths from B to C, etc. In effect, the **superposition principle is inherently recursive**, building larger path amplitudes from sub-path amplitudes. This self-composition might be what endows spacetime with stability and consistency: it continually “recomputes” the next state from the sum of prior possibilities.

Another angle is through **geodesic deviation** and network structures: the manifold’s curvature influences how nearby paths converge or diverge (focusing or defocusing bundles of geodesics). If information from multiple paths feeds back to shape the geometry (in a quantum gravity sense), one could have a **self-consistent loop**: geometry influences path probabilities, which in turn influence geometry. This would be a recursion between the information encoded in geometry and the information encoded in matter fields (the paths of particles). While a full theory of this would require a working theory of quantum gravity (still elusive), conceptually it resonates with approaches where spacetime and matter emerge together from some underlying iterative rule (e.g. cellular automata or spin networks evolving by simple algorithms).

**1.4 Literature Context:** The idea that spacetime might not be fundamental but emergent from more primitive elements has gained traction in several areas. In approaches like **Causal Set theory** or **Loop Quantum Gravity**, spacetime emerges from discrete combinatorial data. In holographic theories (like the AdS/CFT correspondence), spacetime geometry in the bulk is determined by entanglement entropies in a lower-dimensional quantum field theory – “spacetime from entanglement.” Notably, Maldacena and Susskind’s ER=EPR conjecture posits that quantum entanglement (EPR pairs) is equivalent to non-traversable wormholes (ER bridges). This suggests that the *connectedness of spacetime is directly built from information links (entanglement)*. Indeed, it has been argued that spacetime could **emerge from a network of quantum bits**, with distances related to entropic measures of entanglement. Our framework’s view of spacetime containing all forward paths could be seen as a dynamical version of this, where entanglement or information flow along multiple possible paths knits together the manifold’s structure.

Furthermore, the presence of all possible paths implicitly contains the seeds of *multiple histories or many-worlds*. Everett’s Many-Worlds Interpretation of QM holds that all outcomes of quantum events actually occur, each in a separate branch of the universal wavefunction. One can imagine each branch as a different path through the spacetime manifold. The global structure (sometimes called the **multiverse** or universal wavefunction) encompasses all branches; observers within it perceive one realized history. This dovetails with our picture of the manifold encoding all forward paths, and measurement picking out one (see Section 3). In essence, **spacetime plus the quantum principle naturally gives a tree of possible causal histories**, and recursion might be the rule that ties that tree together into a coherent whole.

Finally, we note an interesting mathematical consequence: if spacetime encodes all possible forward paths, the amount of information it contains grows combinatorially with time – because the number of distinct paths from a given starting point proliferates. For $n$ sequential binary choice points, there are $2^n$ possible paths. Nagy’s outline suggested an information growth law $I(n) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, which is roughly $mathcal{O}(n^2)$. This particular formula $frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ happens to count the number of distinct pairs among $n$ items; if interpreted in our context, it could mean that each new “event” (or time step) interacts with all prior events, generating information proportional to the number of prior interactions. This is a **recursive information growth**: as the universe evolves, the web of possible paths and interactions thickens (like a densely connecting graph). The result is that the information content of the universe can grow super-linearly, which might be related to entropy increase or expansion of configuration space. We will revisit the role of information in Section 4.

In summary, by treating spacetime as a Riemannian manifold of potential paths and incorporating recursion, we put forward a vision in which *causality itself is an emergent, self-referential construction*. Each event carries the imprint of countless potential futures and a memory of countless potential pasts, all of which together define a consistent geometry. Spacetime is no longer a passive arena but an active information processor, encoding and propagating the correlations of an evolving system.

*(Potential Figure 1: A schematic "branching spacetime" diagram. One could draw a two-dimensional depiction of time as the vertical axis and one space dimension horizontal. A particle worldline starts at some event and then splits into multiple paths (like a branching tree); those branches later converge or further branch. This illustrates multiple possible causal paths coexisting. Alternatively, a Feynman path integral illustration showing many wiggly paths connecting two points could be shown, emphasizing the idea of summing over possibilities.)*

## 2. Mass and Inertia as Field Displacement: A Laminar Flow Analogy

**2.1 The Puzzle of Mass:** In physics, **mass** has dual facets: (a) Inertia – the resistance of an object to acceleration (as in Newton’s $F = ma$), and (b) Source of gravity – according to GR, mass (more precisely energy-momentum) tells spacetime how to curve. In classical terms, mass is an intrinsic property of matter that we usually take as given. The Standard Model of particle physics explains the *origin of mass* for many particles via the **Higgs mechanism**: the ubiquitous Higgs field has a non-zero vacuum expectation value, and particles interacting with this field acquire effective mass (proportional to their coupling strength to the Higgs). Popular analogies for this process include a particle moving through a crowd or molasses, being “dragged” such that it gains inertia. However, experts caution that the Higgs field does *not* literally work like a viscous drag; it doesn’t dissipate energy or slow particles like a frictional medium. Instead, it endows them with a rest energy.

Nonetheless, the intuition behind those analogies – that mass represents some kind of resistance encountered in a field – can be developed in a more general and perhaps deeper way. Nagy’s framework suggests that **mass could be viewed as a displacement or distortion in some fundamental field or medium**, with resulting **resistance** analogous to **laminar flow** resistance in fluids. Let us unpack this analogy carefully.

**2.2 Laminar Flow Analogy:** *Laminar flow* in fluid dynamics refers to smooth, orderly flow of fluid (often in layers) with no turbulence. When an object moves through a viscous fluid at steady speed (laminar regime), it experiences a drag force (Stokes’ drag for a small sphere, for example) proportional to velocity: $F\_{\text{drag}} = -6\pi \eta R, v$ for a sphere of radius $R$ in a fluid of viscosity $eta$. The fluid’s layers are displaced around the object, and the object feels resistance due to the fluid’s viscosity. In laminar flow, the motion is steady and the disturbances in the fluid (like streamlines) remain constant over time. By contrast, in turbulent flow, chaotic swirls form and drag behavior is more complex.

Drawing an analogy: Suppose space (or a field filling space) behaves somewhat like a fluid. A particle with mass could be seen as an “object” moving through this space-field. If the field has some property analogous to viscosity or inertia, the particle’s motion would “displace” the field locally and the field would in turn exert a resistive force on the particle. This back-action would manifest as inertia: the particle doesn’t change its state of motion freely; it requires a force to overcome the field’s resistance to displacement. Thus, **inertia might emerge from the interaction between an object and the field it’s moving through**. Historically, one might liken this to the old idea of the luminiferous aether or Einstein’s early thoughts on Mach’s principle (where inertia arises from interaction with the mass of the universe). Our modern understanding with the Higgs field is similar in spirit: particles are coupled to an all-pervading scalar field.

However, Nagy’s analogy goes beyond just the Higgs mechanism. It implies that *all* mass and even gravity itself could be understood with a fluid-like picture. Consider **General Relativity’s** statement: mass-energy curves spacetime. One common visualization is a heavy ball deforming a rubber sheet. Another (perhaps closer to fluid analogies) is **frame-dragging**: a rotating mass “drags along” the spacetime around it, much like a spinning sphere in molasses would drag fluid with it. Indeed, the Lense-Thirring frame-dragging effect confirmed by Gravity Probe B can be described by saying Earth’s rotation twists the surrounding spacetime fabric – *“as if the spinning Earth were swirling the spacetime fluid around with it.”* In a fluid picture, spacetime itself has properties akin to viscosity and vorticity, and mass in motion sets it moving.

Recent research has explicitly considered spacetime as a sort of fluid. For instance, some quantum gravity approaches suggest spacetime at small scales might behave like a **superfluid** with near-zero viscosity. If spacetime were a perfect fluid (superfluid), an object moving through it might experience *no* viscous drag (hence our world doesn’t exhibit obvious resistance to steady motion – consistent with Newton’s first law). However, if there are any slight departures from perfect fluidity, there could be tiny dissipative effects (which researchers have sought constraints on via high-energy photon propagation tests). The current evidence suggests if spacetime is fluid-like, it must be extremely low-viscosity (superfluid).

Within Nagy’s framework, we might interpret **mass as a topological or geometrical defect** in the information manifold (discussed in Section 1). Mass “displaces” the field of information or the geometry of spacetime. For example, in a recursive information network, perhaps each “unit” of mass corresponds to a certain pattern of recursive self-reference that “uses up” some degrees of freedom – analogous to how putting a ball in a fluid displaces volume. The surrounding geometry then has to adjust (curve or flow around the mass unit), and that adjustment is what we recognize as gravitational field. The resistance encountered in accelerating the mass unit would then be the network’s reluctance to perturb its established pattern.

**2.3 Mathematical Formalism:** We can ground some of these ideas more rigorously by recalling known field equations. Einstein’s field equation $G\_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T\_{\mu\nu}$ directly ties matter (stress-energy tensor $T\_{\mu\nu}$) to curvature (the Einstein tensor $G\_{\mu\nu}$). In a weak-field, slow-motion limit, this gives rise to **Newtonian gravity** plus frame-dragging effects. The presence of $T\_{00}$ (energy density) produces the static gravitational potential (like the $-\frac{GM}{r}$ field), while $T\_{0i}$ (mass-current, analogous to electrical current in magnetism) produces gravitomagnetic fields, causing frame-dragging. The formal analogy between electromagnetism and gravity in this linearized limit is called **gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM)**. In GEM, equations resemble Maxwell’s equations; for example, a moving mass current produces a “magnetic”-like field that can drag objects – just as a moving charge produces a magnetic field. This is a precise way to see the analogy: a rotating mass generates a gravitomagnetic field that “drags spacetime” around (Lense-Thirring effect). It is explicitly stated that frame-dragging can be viewed as **gravitational induction**, analogous to how a moving charge induces magnetic effects.

Now, how to interpret this in emergent, fluid terms? If spacetime or the gravitational field is emergent from an information medium, then mass moving through it induces a whirl or distortion in that medium, exactly like a spoon stirring a fluid. Laminar flow would correspond to a steady state solution of the field equations around a moving mass. If the mass moves at constant velocity, in GR one gets a stationary field configuration (analogous to Cherenkov radiation if faster than light in a medium, but subluminal steady motion doesn’t radiate in vacuum). If the mass accelerates, it emits gravitational waves – like an accelerating charge emits electromagnetic waves or like a disturbance in fluid sending ripples.

**2.4 Laminar vs. Turbulent Regimes of Reality:** An intriguing speculation is that perhaps the distinction between *laminar and turbulent flow* could mirror the distinction between stable, coherent physical systems and chaotic ones. For instance, an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is a stable (stationary) state – perhaps corresponding to a laminar self-reinforcing pattern in the underlying field. By contrast, a highly excited or non-equilibrium system might correspond to turbulence in the foundational informational substrate. This is just an analogy, but it suggests that stable particles and quantization might be the “smooth flow patterns” of the underlying system, whereas instabilities or decays are where the smooth flow breaks into chaotic eddies (which could correspond to particle creation, energy dissipation, etc.).

**2.5 Summation of the Analogy:** We propose the following interpretation:

* *Mass* = a measure of how much the presence of an entity **distorts the underlying field** (spacetime/information field) and how much that distortion **resists change**. A massive particle is like a bedrock pattern in the sea of information that is not easily budged. This aligns with the concept of **mass as energy** as well – creating a distortion (like a curvature) requires energy.
* *Inertia* = the **resistance** of that distortion to acceleration through the field. This emerges because accelerating the mass means continually creating a new pattern of field displacement; if the field has to adjust, it “pushes back” akin to fluid drag.
* *Gravity* = the **interaction** of two masses’ field distortions. In a fluid, two vortices or two moving bodies can influence each other’s flow. In gravitation, two masses curve spacetime and effectively move “downhill” in each other’s curvature. From the field perspective, one mass’s distortion creates a gradient that the other mass’s pattern tends to slide into – which is just another way to describe gravitational attraction.

To be clear, this section’s discussion is largely a conceptual reframing of well-known physics (the origin of inertia and gravity) into a **field-displacement metaphor**. The novelty lies in integrating it with the recursive, information-based view: if we ultimately model everything in a computational SEP, then what we call a “field” here would be implemented as part of that processor’s state, and mass would be something like a self-referential subroutine or data structure that maintains itself (giving rest mass) and influences others (giving forces).

**Literature Note:** Historically, there are similar ideas. The notion that **inertia arises from interaction with the rest of the universe** (Mach’s principle) influenced Einstein. Later Dennis Sciama formulated a gravitomagnetic theory of inertia. More recently, approaches like **“Emergent Gravity”** (e.g. Erik Verlinde’s entropic gravity) suggest gravity is not fundamental but emerges from thermodynamics of information (with inertial resistance tied to entropy gradients). Our framework’s laminar flow analogy is in the same spirit of seeking an underlying medium or mechanism that makes inertia and gravity byproducts of deeper dynamics. We provide this perspective as one plausible interpretation that will feed into our computational model (Section 6).

*(Potential Figure 2: Illustration of the laminar flow analogy. One could show a sphere moving through a viscous fluid with streamlines drawn (smooth flow lines around the sphere), and annotate it to say "Field lines around a mass in spacetime". Another panel could compare this to the rubber sheet gravity analogy or frame-dragging: e.g. show a rotating sphere and swirling fluid around it, analogous to Earth dragging spacetime. If possible, a simple diagram of frame-dragging could be shown, with arrows indicating how spacetime is twisted by a rotating mass.)*

## 3. Quantum Measurement as Emergence of a Local Frame from Global Potential

**3.1 The Measurement Problem Restated:** Quantum mechanics allows a system to exist in a **superposition** of eigenstates. Prior to measurement, the state can be described by a wavefunction $|\Psi\rangle = \sum\_i c\_i |\psi\_i\rangle$, where ${|\psi\_i\rangle}$ are eigenstates of the observable being measured (with eigenvalues corresponding to possible outcomes). Upon measurement, however, we *observe* a single outcome $|\psi\_k\rangle$, and standard quantum theory prescribes that the wavefunction “collapses” to that eigenstate. This apparent discontinuous change is not derived from Schrödinger’s deterministic equation – it is “inserted” via the Copenhagen interpretation’s postulates. The **measurement problem** thus asks: *how and why do definite outcomes occur, given that the prior state can be a superposition?* In other words, what selects one branch of the wavefunction for our experience, and what happens to the information in the other branches?

Our framework offers an answer grounded in the idea of **emergence of a local reference frame from a global potential**. Here, “global potential” refers to the full wavefunction or quantum state encompassing all possibilities (the superposition, representing a global, delocalized state of knowledge or existence). A “local reference frame” refers to the perspective of a specific observer or outcome where things appear definite and classical. We assert that a measurement is the **recursive selection or creation of a local frame out of the global quantum state**. In plainer terms, the act of measurement is the universe deciding, via a recursive internal process, to treat one part of itself as a stable frame of reference relative to which other properties are determined.

**3.2 Relational Perspective and Decoherence:** This idea resonates with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics. In **Relational Quantum Mechanics** (Rovelli, 1996), the quantum state is not absolute but is always relative to an observer or another system. There is no “God’s eye view” of the wavefunction collapse; instead, when two systems interact (e.g. an apparatus and a particle), they become correlated, and the outcome is defined relative to that correlation. One could say the systems now share a **relation** that constitutes a measurement. Similarly, the theory of **Quantum Decoherence** (Zurek et al.) explains that when a quantum system interacts with a large environment (including a measuring device), the global system’s state becomes an entangled superposition of many branches, each of which contains a consistent record (device reading) of a particular outcome. The interference between branches is suppressed (because they get entangled with different, orthogonal environment states), effectively **irreversibly “de-localizing” phase information** into the environment. What remains for any local observer is a mixed state that *looks like* a random selection of one outcome. However, in the total state there is still a superposition of apparatus+system states.

The key point is: after decoherence, each branch can be viewed as an emergent **classical frame** where the outcome is definite. In each branch, the observer (or measuring device) has a definite reading and can safely use classical logic within that branch. From *within* a branch, it’s as if wavefunction collapse happened. But from the outside (super-observer perspective), there is still a global superposition. Everett’s **Many-Worlds Interpretation** simply says each branch/world is real and there is no singular collapse – rather the universe’s state is the collection of all branches (the multiverse). The lingering question in many-worlds is why an observer *experiences* only one branch and not a weird superposition of branches. The answer given is that the observer is itself split and resides in each branch separately, with no communication between branches, so subjectively there’s only one outcome perceived.

Our framework essentially adopts this decoherence/Many-Worlds picture but emphasizes the **recursive, self-referential nature** of how one branch becomes an **experienced reality**. We claim that a measurement is an *emergent phenomenon* in which the global state “chooses” a self-consistent subset of itself to instantiate as a local reality. This is reminiscent of an observer “carving out” a piece of the universal wavefunction as “the world I see.”

**3.3 Mechanism via Recursion:** How could recursion drive this selection? One way to visualize it is through **fixed points**. Suppose the universe’s state is described by some huge wavefunction. Now suppose the universe is querying itself – a reflective operation. (Wheeler’s participatory universe idea imagined that reality is built from Q\&A sessions of observers with the universe – here the observer and system might be parts of one whole, asking and answering questions recursively.) A measurement is like asking: “What is the value of observable $X$ for system $S$?” This question is implemented by an interaction (Hamiltonian coupling) between $S$ and apparatus $M$ (and environment). The combined system $S+M$ evolves into an entangled state $sum\_i c\_i |x\_i$ ra\_S |M\_i\ra\_M$, where $|M\_i\ra$ is the apparatus state recording outcome $x\_i$. Now, here is where *recursion* enters: the apparatus $M$ is often ultimately observed by a conscious observer $O$, which is another quantum system. So we get $S + M + O$ entangled: $sum\_i c\_i |x\_i\ra\_S |M\_i\ra\_M |O\_i\ra\_O$. The state $|O\_i\ra\_O$ means “observer has perceived outcome $x\_i$.” At this stage, each term of the superposition contains a full self-consistent record of a particular outcome. If the observer O is included, each branch even has a version of the observer who believes a specific result occurred.

From the internal perspective of any one branch, the system appears to have “collapsed” into $|x\_i\ra$. The **local frame of reference** (defined by the observer’s experience in that branch) has no access to the other branches. Thus, the observer can now treat the outcome as a classical fact. In effect, **the global quantum state has spun off a localized classical reality.**

What drove the selection of that specific branch for the observer? Here we invoke a recursive consistency or **stable-self** principle: The observer finds themself in *some* branch – but whichever branch they find must be one where all records agree and the physical laws hold (e.g. the device reading correlates with the particle state, etc.). The branches where inconsistent or non-classical outcomes happened are not viable for continued existence of a classical observer. One might say they interfere away or do not lead to stable structures. The “preferred basis” for measurement outcomes (the basis in which decoherence occurs) is typically the one that yields robust, classical-like states (also called pointer states by Zurek). These are states that survive interaction with environment without superposing again. That selection – the pointer basis – is itself found by a kind of variational or iterative criterion (usually, maximizing decoherence rate or stability). This is a **recursive selection rule**: the quantum system “chooses” the basis that best persists (which depends on system-environment dynamics), then one element of that basis is realized per branch.

In Nagy’s terms, **quantum measurement is the emergence of a local frame** (one branch) **from the global potential** (the superposition) via a recursive self-reference that yields consistency. Each branch can be thought of as the universe observing itself in a particular way. The whole structure remains, but it contains self-contained substructures (branches with observers).

We can draw a parallel to how a mathematical **fixed point** arises: if you have a function $f$ and you seek a point $x$ such that $f(x)=x$, often an iterative process (like $x\_{n+1}=f(x\_n)$) will converge to a stable fixed point. In measurement, one might consider that the act of observation is like an operator $hat{O}$ acting on the state which, when consistently applied, “projects” the state into an eigenstate (an eigenstate is a fixed point of the measurement operator action: measure twice, get the same result). Repeated observation (or widespread entanglement with environment) enforces that stability. So the system sort of “chooses” an eigenstate such that it is stable under the recursive act of measuring again (i.e., the outcome doesn’t change upon immediate re-measurement). Through this recursive stabilization, a particular result is locked in.

**3.4 Locality and Reference Frames:** The phrase “local reference frame” also hints at relativity: in GR, all physics is local and there are no global inertial frames, only local ones. Interestingly, one can’t define a universal quantum state collapse that all observers agree on in relativity – different observers can disagree on the order of spacelike-separated measurements. This suggests that collapse/measurement might be an observer-dependent, local phenomenon. In our framework, the emergence of a local frame from the global state is consistent with that: each observer (with their apparatus) effectively carves out their pocket of reality. Another observer, far away, might carve out a different pocket, and only when their information is compared do we ensure consistency (which is handled by entanglement and ultimately by causal communication of results).

**3.5 Supporting Evidence:** While this interpretation is somewhat philosophical, it is supported by how quantum mechanics actually works in practice. For example, in the **Many-Worlds view**, one puzzle is why we perceive a single world. A common explanation is exactly what we have described: *because “we” (as physical observers) become split among the branches, each copy of us perceives only its own branch*. So the phenomenon of a definite outcome is essentially an emergent, subjective one – emergent from the global wavefunction’s perspective, but very real to the internal observer. Sabine Hossenfelder, in discussing this, notes that under Many-Worlds the only “loss” is *“relative to a local measurement”* – globally no information is lost, but locally you see one outcome. This aligns with our statement that a local frame emerges.

We can even write down the state explicitly with observer included as is done in thought experiments:

$$
|\Psi_{\text{initial}}\ra_{S+M+O} = \Big( c_1 |x_1\ra_S + c_2 |x_2\ra_S \Big) \otimes |M_{\text{ready}}\ra_M \otimes |O_{\text{neutral}}\ra_O.
$$

After interaction,

$$
|\Psi_{\text{entangled}}\ra = c_1 |x_1\ra_S |M_1\ra_M |O_1\ra_O + c_2 |x_2\ra_S |M_2\ra_M |O_2\ra_O,
$$

where $|O\_i\ra$ means observer seeing outcome $i$. At this point, each term is a fully consistent world. Now, *for each observer state $|O\_i\ra$ within its branch*, the rest of the state appears collapsed. I.e., an observer in state $|O\_1\ra$ sees the system in $|x\_1\ra$. If they check the apparatus state, they find $|M\_1\ra$. No interference with $|O\_2\ra$ occurs because $la O\_1 | O\_2 \ra = 0$. Thus the branches have **orthogonal observer frames**. Each is effectively a separate coordinate system in Hilbert space that does not interfere with the other. The global state still has both, but the observers inside have their local frames.

**3.6 Conclusion of This Section:** In simpler words, our framework suggests that **“collapse” is when the universe looks at itself recursively and decides on a story to tell itself locally**. The global potential (all possible stories) remains in the background (perhaps accessible only to a super-observer or via interference experiments), but a consistent narrative (one sequence of events) is chosen for the local actors. This view demystifies measurement by not invoking any new physics beyond quantum entanglement and consistency – it’s an emergent, high-level process when seen from within the system.

It also hints at a resolution of the measurement problem *without* modifying quantum theory: the laws of physics (unitary evolution) are always respected globally, but the phenomena of classical outcomes and apparent collapse are emergent consequences of how information flows in a recursive system. This is compatible with and builds upon the theory of decoherence, adding a layer of interpretation that emphasizes self-reference (the universe observing itself) as the engine of collapse.

*(Potential Figure 3: A diagram of quantum measurement in the Many-Worlds or branching sense. For example, a cartoon where a quantum system in superposition interacts with a detector, splitting into two branches. In one branch, the detector reads “up” and an observer is happy; in the other, detector reads “down” and observer is surprised, etc. Each branch has a copy of the observer. An arrow could indicate that each observer sees only their branch (local frame), while the global wavefunction encompasses both. This would visually convey the emergence of a local reality from a global superposition.)*

## 4. Information as Uncertainty, Recursion as Coherence Mechanism

**4.1 Information-Theoretic Ontology:** One of the bold claims in Nagy’s outline is identifying **information with uncertainty**, and further saying that **recursion is the mechanism of coherence** in the physical world. To unpack this, we first clarify what we mean by information in a physical sense.

In Shannon’s information theory, **information** is defined as the reduction in uncertainty. If you have many possible messages (outcomes) and you learn which one happened, you gain information. The **entropy** $H$ quantifies the average uncertainty before you know the outcome. For example, one fair coin flip has 1 bit of entropy (2 equally likely outcomes, uncertainty = 1 bit). If we extend this idea to the physical state of a system, the entropy can measure our uncertainty about its exact microstate. Equivalently, it measures the information **missing** from our knowledge of the microstate given some macrostate description. In thermodynamics, Boltzmann and Gibbs defined entropy in a way that is mathematically analogous to Shannon’s formula, and indeed in modern physics we freely talk about information entropy in physical contexts. Landauer’s principle even links erasing one bit of information to a minimum dissipation of $k\_B T \ln 2$ energy as heat, underscoring that information is a physical quantity.

Now, if **information = uncertainty**, then a state of maximum information is also a state of maximal uncertainty. That sounds paradoxical at first – we tend to think of “more information” as meaning more knowledge (less uncertainty). But what Nagy likely means is that **information content** is measured by the uncertainty it could resolve. A completely certain situation carries *no new information*, because everything is already determined. A highly uncertain situation has the capacity to reveal a lot of information once resolved. Thus, the **potential information** is the uncertainty.

If we apply this to the universe as a whole: The initial state of the universe (depending on viewpoint) could be considered to have extremely low entropy (according to cosmologists, the early universe had low thermodynamic entropy) but also to us it's uncertain because we don't know the initial conditions in detail. As the universe evolves, entropy increases, which means uncertainty (from an observer within) about the exact microstate increases – yet more bits are needed to describe it. If the total information content is conserved (as quantum theory suggests via unitarity), then one might say the universe’s total information is constant, but our local uncertainty grows. Nagy’s framework possibly treats *information as a conserved substance* in a way analogous to energy, or at least treats reality as fundamentally made of information (as per Wheeler’s it-from-bit).

**4.2 Coherence Through Recursion:** The second part, “recursion as mechanism of coherence,” implies that the repetitive, self-referential interactions in the system generate order and reduce uncertainty locally (thus creating what we experience as information or knowledge). **Coherence** in physics generally refers to a stable phase relationship in a wave (like laser light is coherent light), or to parts of a system being correlated in a definite way. For instance, a coherent quantum state is one where phases are well-defined relative to each other. **Decoherence**, conversely, is loss of such phase relationships due to entanglement with environment (leading to effectively probabilistic mixtures).

So why would recursion produce coherence? Consider a simple recursive process: iterative feedback or repetition tends to reinforce certain patterns. For example, in a laser cavity, light bouncing between mirrors with a gain medium will reinforce the wavelengths that fit an integer number of half-wavelengths between the mirrors – that’s a kind of recursion (the light field recirculates) yielding a coherent mode. In iterative maps and dynamical systems, a stable cycle or fixed point often emerges due to repeated application of a rule (if the system is well-behaved). Similarly, error-correcting codes use feedback and redundancy (a form of recursive check) to maintain a coherent message in the presence of noise.

One might abstractly say: **coherence = consistency across iterations**. If our universe performs some kind of self-consistency check (as a recursive simulation might), then only those states that remain consistent after multiple “iterations” will persist. This can explain why macroscopically we see an ordered classical world – because it’s a self-consistent narrative that’s been reinforced by many interactions, whereas wild quantum superpositions at large scale fail the consistency check and are suppressed (decoherence kills them early).

Additionally, recursion can generate fractal-like structures, which show self-similarity (a form of correlation across scale). Perhaps physical laws across different scales (micro vs macro) have coherence because of an underlying recursive rule (this echoes ideas of scale invariance and renormalization group: physics often exhibits similar structures at different scales, at least in critical systems or fractal-like phenomena).

**4.3 Recursive Computation and Emergent Order:** Let’s bring in the computational viewpoint through SEP (which we detail in Section 6). A **Self-Emergent Processor** would presumably operate by taking its own output as input repeatedly, gradually refining structures. This is analogous to algorithms that converge to a solution by iteration. For example, think of an algorithm trying to solve a puzzle: it might repeatedly improve a guess until a self-consistent solution is reached. The universe, by continually “processing” its state through physical law, might similarly converge local parts of the system to consistent configurations (like planets, atoms, galaxies – stable structures) which are coherent, while inconsistent ones (like halfway states) are unstable and disappear.

In the historical foundations snippet, Nagy references Gödel (1931) – which brings to mind self-reference and incompleteness – and Lorenz & Mandelbrot (chaos and fractals), indicating recursion’s role in complex pattern formation. **Chaos theory** showed that very simple recursive formulas (like the logistic map) can produce rich, complex, yet self-similar patterns (feather-like fractals, strange attractors). **Fractals** are often generated by recursive algorithms and have infinite detail yet overall coherence (the famous Mandelbrot set arises from recursively iterating a complex quadratic function and seeing which points remain bounded – coherence being boundedness here). This might be an analogy for how complexity in the universe (like life or consciousness) might arise from recursive feedback loops in information.

**4.4 Information Binding and Gravity:** A striking line from Nagy’s notes was: *“Information acts as gravitational coherence binding identity units.”* In light of what we've discussed, this sounds like a hypothesis that **mutual information or entanglement** between parts of a system could play a role analogous to gravity in pulling things together. This idea has a concrete parallel: In recent quantum gravity research, it’s been noted that **entanglement can create an attractive force** between subsystems in certain circumstances. Moreover, the ER=EPR conjecture we cited earlier suggests that maximally entangled particles (with lots of shared information) are connected by a sort of wormhole. Van Raamsdonk (2010) argued that increasing entanglement between two halves of space causes the geometry to “glue” together – if you gradually reduce entanglement, space can tear apart into disconnected pieces. Thus **information (entanglement) is literally what stitches spacetime together** in those models. If we interpret “identity units” as perhaps basic entities or maybe observers, then information binding them could mean that shared information (correlations) is what holds composite structures together.

One could interpret an atom or a molecule this way: what holds a molecule together? Bonds, which are electrical forces, but underlying that is a stable pattern of electrons and nuclei exchanging photons – an information flow. If that pattern lost coherence (electrons decohering randomly), the bond breaks. Similarly, what holds a star system together? Gravity, but perhaps one could say the star and planet share information via gravitational fields. It's a less usual way to think, but consider that gravity can be seen as a sort of potential well where things are correlated (all planets orbit same mass center). Perhaps one could quantify a kind of mutual information between masses due to gravitational interaction (though not straightforward in classical terms, maybe in quantum gravity context).

At minimum, the phrase implies **information has a binding effect** – reminiscent of how in our social or biological realm, information (like DNA code, or shared knowledge in a society) binds components into a larger whole.

**4.5 Summing Up Section 4:** We have argued that if uncertainty is fundamental (the universe at its core is a superposition – a state of potential information), then what we experience as “real” information (definite bits) emerges when that uncertainty is resolved through some recursive process. That process enforces coherence (internal consistency) and reduces the possible states (projecting from uncertainty to certainty in one branch). Recursion in the laws or in the evolution allows the system to **remember and reinforce certain patterns** – those become the stable information (like memories, records, structures).

In technical terms, one could imagine a quantity like **algorithmic information content** or **Kolmogorov complexity** also being relevant: a recursive system might compress information by finding patterns, effectively lowering the description complexity of the world by encoding regularities (like physical laws themselves are concise descriptions of many observations). Perhaps the laws of physics are the fixed points of a recursive search for compression of the universe’s information – an outlandish but fascinating idea: that the reason the world has simple laws is that any self-consistent recursion will tend to find a simple set of rules that generate the observed pattern, because those rules succinctly encode the information.

While these ideas verge on philosophical, they can be grounded in examples (fractal generation, error correction, etc.). We will employ them later when discussing the **Self-Emergent Processor** design: it will rely on recursive algorithms to produce globally coherent patterns from simple local rules, demonstrating how complexity and order (coherence) can spontaneously arise.

*(Potential Figure 4: Perhaps a diagram showing a feedback loop leading to order. For instance, illustrate a simple iterative map that converges to a stable cycle (coherent state), or a depiction of a fractal (like the Mandelbrot set) vs random noise to symbolize coherence from recursion versus incoherence. Another idea: show two clocks or oscillators initially out of sync that, when coupled (information exchanged), synchronize – synchronization is coherence achieved via interaction (a form of recursion). This would underscore that information exchange can bind and synchronize units analogous to gravity pulling masses together.)*

## 5. Cosmological Implications: Big Bang as Phase Transition, not Singularity

**5.1 The Singularity Problem:** In the classical Big Bang cosmology based on GR, if one extrapolates the expansion of the universe backward in time, one arrives at a state of infinite density, temperature, and curvature at a vanishingly small scale factor – this is $t=0$, the Big Bang singularity. However, a **singularity** is generally a sign that a physical theory has been pushed beyond its domain of validity (in this case, beyond where quantum gravitational effects can be neglected). Many physicists consider the Big Bang singularity “unphysical” or at least not a literal description of reality, but rather an artifact signaling the need for a new theory of quantum gravity. As Scientific American succinctly put it, the singularity is seen by many as *“a mathematically meaningless proposition that indicates a theory has gone off the rails.”*.

Therefore, a common line of inquiry in cosmology is how to avoid the initial singularity. Several ideas have been proposed: **cosmic inflation** posits a prior epoch that, while not removing the singular $t=0$, at least dramatically changes the narrative for $t > 10^{-33}$ s onward; **quantum cosmology** models such as the **Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal** suggest the universe could have no initial boundary in time (time becomes space-like at very early moments, smoothing out the singularity); **Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC)** yields a Big **Bounce** scenario where a prior contracting universe rebounded into expansion due to quantum gravity effects that create a repulsive force at extreme density; other proposals include string-theoretic pre-Big-Bang or Ekpyrotic scenarios (colliding branes, etc.), which often replace the Bang with a collision or transition.

Nagy’s framework specifically suggests reinterpreting the Big Bang as a **phase transition** rather than the absolute beginning. A phase transition in cosmology means there was some earlier state (or phase) of the system which underwent a rapid change of state, yielding the hot, expanding universe we see emerging from the “Bang”. This could align with certain existing theories:

* **Symmetry-breaking phase transitions**: It is believed that as the universe cooled in the first fractions of a second, it went through phase changes – for example, at $sim 10^{-37}$ s, the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) phase transition might have occurred, perhaps releasing latent heat and triggering inflation; at $10^{-12}$ s, the electroweak symmetry broke, giving mass to W and Z bosons (Higgs mechanism turning on); at $10^{-6}$ s, the quark-gluon plasma condensed into hadrons. These are transitions within the Big Bang timeline. But Nagy likely means something even more radical: that the *Big Bang itself* was a transition from a prior state.

* **Big Bounce**: In a bounce, the prior state is a collapsing universe. Near the would-be singularity, new physics (like LQC’s discrete space or stringy effects) causes a bounce to expansion. This is literally a phase change from contraction to expansion. Turok & Gielen’s work (2016) demonstrated a model in which the universe could smoothly tunnel through $a=0$ without singularity. Steinhardt and collaborators have also explored cyclic models where each bang is a transition rather than a creation event.

* **Vacuum phase transition**: Some have suggested that “before” the Big Bang there might have been a metastable vacuum (a “false vacuum”) that decayed (a bit like a supercooled liquid suddenly crystallizing). That vacuum decay could release enormous energy – essentially a Bang – and create the hot plasma. This is somewhat like inflation’s idea (inflation often uses the decay of the inflaton field’s false vacuum to end inflation in a bang of particle production). But one could imagine a universe that was in some quiescent void and then nucleated a bubble of lower-energy vacuum that became our universe.

In all these cases, **time does not begin at a singular point**; instead, there is a prior epoch or a different regime of physics that smoothly or at least comprehensibly leads into the hot dense state we call the Big Bang.

**5.2 Phase Transition Viewpoint:** What does it mean conceptually to call the Big Bang a phase transition? A phase transition implies:

* There are at least two phases: “before” and “after” (though ‘before’ might not be classical time; it could be an Euclidean phase as in Hartle-Hawking).
* There is an order parameter that changes, or symmetry that breaks.
* Possibly a release or absorption of latent heat or a change in degrees of freedom.

For instance, one could speculate: before the Big Bang, the universe was in a symmetric, low-entropy state (maybe all spatial points were identified, or quantum geometry in a condensate state). At the “Bang”, this symmetry broke (space-time crystallized into our 3+1D expanding manifold), releasing the energy that became matter and radiation. Some researchers (e.g. in superfluid models of spacetime) talk about a **spacetime condensation temperature** – if the universe cooled below a critical point, spacetime ‘condensed’ from a more quantum state to a classical state, somewhat akin to how a liquid can freeze into a solid.

Nagy’s recursive framework might offer a twist: perhaps the universe “bootstrapped” itself into a new phase via a critical recursive process. For example, once enough informational degrees of freedom ‘looped’ together, a classical universe could emerge. This sounds reminiscent of **criticality**: many complex systems have a critical point at which qualitative new behavior emerges (water boiling, magnets ordering, etc.). The Big Bang could be the critical point of the universe’s self-processing algorithm – before it, no clear spacetime or particles (just potential, information soup); after it, the stable structures form.

**5.3 Addressing Open Questions with This View:**

* *Horizon and Flatness Problems*: In standard Big Bang, why is the universe so homogeneous (horizon problem) and why is space so flat (flatness problem)? Inflation theory answered these by exponential expansion smoothing things out. A phase transition viewpoint could also help: if the Bang is like a condensation from a single coherent pre-state, then initial conditions might naturally be homogeneous and flat (like a crystal forming uniformly). Alternatively, in a cyclic model, some of these conditions are reset each cycle.
* *Origin of Time*: If the Bang is not the ultimate beginning, then time (or whatever preceded time) existed before. Some models like Penrose’s Conformal Cyclic Cosmology even suggest an infinite sequence of eons with Big Bangs as transitions between them, each “Big Bang” actually being an asymptotic continuation of the remote future of a prior universe, scaled down.
* *Entropy*: A big puzzle is that the Big Bang had extremely low entropy (given the same mass in a black hole would have huge entropy), which enabled the second law to produce increasing entropy since then. A phase transition could explain a low entropy start if the prior phase was highly ordered (like a cold, symmetric state that then breaks symmetry). The phase transition might produce many particles (raising entropy a bit), but still the initial condition of the new phase is special (like supercooled water forming ice crystals – the initial crystal is highly ordered).
* *Baryogenesis and other one-time events*: Many important things (matter-antimatter asymmetry, for instance) are thought to have arisen due to conditions around the electroweak/GUT transitions. If Big Bang itself is a transition, perhaps features like net matter content could result from topological defects or bias in that process.

**5.4 Example: Big Bounce in Loop Quantum Cosmology:** Loop quantum gravity suggests space is discrete, and as density increases, there is a maximum before quantum pressure causes expansion. The Friedman equation gets modified to $dot{a}^2 \propto \rho(1 - \rho/\rho\_c)$ which gives $rho\_{\text{max}} = \rho\_c$ finite, and when $rho$ reaches $rho\_c$, $H=\dot{a}/a$ goes to zero and then imaginary (flips sign) – so $a$ stops contracting and starts expanding. This is a concrete example of a cosmological phase transition: from contraction to expansion, with $rho\_c$ marking a new “phase” where gravity effectively becomes repulsive. The transition is nonsingular and theoretically unitary. Studies (like those referenced by SciAm) show quantum tunneling through singularity is possible, giving a consistent evolution.

**5.5 SEP and the Big Bang:** Now, connecting to the recursive framework: if the universe is a SEP, one might imagine that initially the processor was in some trivial or ground state (maybe no space, no time, just a high symmetry information sea). Then at some “algorithmic critical point” it entered a new regime (like starting a computation) that creates complexity – that moment would correspond to the Big Bang. Possibly the “before” state was something like an empty cellular automaton and the “after” state is a running automaton generating patterns. The transition could be triggered by a recursive event – maybe the system reached a certain size or certain number of recursion steps and underwent a qualitative change. This is, of course, speculative since we don’t have the actual SEP algorithm yet.

**5.6 Critique of Singularity in Context:** Nagy’s critique aligns with the mainstream in being skeptical that a literal singularity occurred. Our vantage, after decades of theoretical work, is that singularities are either hidden in black holes (censored by horizons) or avoided by new physics in extreme conditions. The **Big Bang singularity** is not hidden – it’s our past – so almost certainly it demands new physics to understand it. By framing it as a phase transition, we are essentially saying: apply the lessons of condensed matter and modern cosmology – treat the birth of our universe like a physical event with a ‘before’ and ‘after’ and discover what physical laws governed that event.

The phase transition perspective also invites perhaps an **order parameter**: what variable drastically changed at the Bang? It could be something like the dimensionality of space (some theories consider that early on, there were effectively more spatial dimensions that “froze” out leaving 3), or the degree of freedom of geometry (from quantum indeterminacy of geometry to classical definite geometry). In any case, pinpointing such an order parameter would make the picture testable or at least concrete.

**5.7 Observational Possibilities:** If the Big Bang was a bounce or phase change, are there observable relics? Possibly:

* A bounce might leave imprints like a specific spectrum of gravitational waves. Some upcoming experiments (CMB polarization, or space-based GW detectors) might see hints of a pre-inflationary bounce.
* Phase transitions can produce defects – e.g., cosmic strings from symmetry breaking. Maybe a Big Bang phase change produced relic topological defects or particular non-Gaussian features in the cosmic microwave background.
* If time is cyclic, perhaps patterns in the CMB or distribution of black hole masses could correlate between cycles (Penrose has claimed evidence of pre-Big-Bang black hole “Hawking points” in the CMB, controversially).
* If Big Bang was a vacuum decay, maybe we are in a bubble universe and could detect its wall or effect of bubble collision (though none seen so far in CMB data).

The details go beyond our scope, but we highlight these to show this is not idle musing; cosmologists actively consider these alternatives.

**5.8 Conclusion of Section 5:** Viewing the Big Bang as a phase transition elegantly fits into a recursive emergent framework: it implies that what we call the beginning was actually *a transformation* in a pre-existing system. It aligns with the theme of emergence (the universe emerged from some pre-universe by a drastic change of state) and with the theme of recursion (maybe cycles of universe or iterative pre-big-bang dynamics lead to the new phase). It also resonates with information theory – phase transitions often involve symmetry (information) change, like going from a symmetric vacuum to one with less symmetry (thus more “information content” in structure). If the pre-Bang state was symmetric and simple, and post-Bang is rich and structured, that’s the emergence of information (as complexity) at the cost of symmetry.

In summary, Nagy’s proposal decouples the origin of *everything* from a singular point and instead suggests continuity and cause: something caused the Bang, and that something can be studied within the laws of physics (even if new laws are needed). It removes the need for a miraculous creation ex nihilo and instead frames our universe as part of a larger, possibly cyclic or higher-dimensional, reality.

## 6. The Self-Emergent Processor (SEP): A Computational Platform for Emergent Physics

Having outlined the theoretical pillars of Nagy’s framework in the preceding sections, we now turn to the proposal of a **Self-Emergent Processor (SEP)** – essentially, a computational toy universe designed to simulate and test these concepts. The SEP is envisioned as a recursive computational system in which *“identity, complexity, and meaning arise naturally”* from simple rules. In other words, SEP is a laboratory to study how reality-like phenomena could emerge from informational processes.

**6.1 Concept and Goals:** At its core, SEP is likely a kind of **network or automaton** that continuously updates according to local rules with a recursive element (the rules can act on the results of their previous application, etc.). The ambition is that within this evolving computation, structures will self-organize that can be interpreted as analogs of particles, forces, space, time, etc. Ultimately, one would like SEP to demonstrate:

* **Emergent spacetime:** The “locations” or nodes in the computation develop into a metric space, possibly with something akin to geodesics (see Section 1’s ideas).
* **Emergent particles/fields:** Certain patterns in the data behave like mass or fields (Section 2’s analogy).
* **Quantum-like behavior:** Perhaps the system uses digital bits but could exhibit analogs of superposition or probabilistic branching if designed cleverly (maybe through nondeterministic rules or through large-scale patterns where deterministic chaos mimics probability).
* **Measurement-like events:** Where parts of the system interact and yield stable outcomes, analogous to Section 3’s discussion.
* **Increasing complexity:** The system should not quickly settle into a boring fixed point; it should generate complexity over time (like our universe formed galaxies, life, etc.). Recursion might produce fractal-like growth of structure.
* **Adaptability or Self-tuning:** Possibly the term “processor” implies it can process inputs; maybe SEP can be perturbed or given goals. Self-emergent might imply it can evolve its own rules or optimize itself – like a learning algorithm at the level of the universe.

In historical context, SEP is reminiscent of past “digital physics” models:

* **Cellular Automata Universe:** e.g., Stephen Wolfram’s 1D automata or 2D **Game of Life** have shown how simple binary rules can yield complex emergent patterns, sometimes analogous to particles (Game of Life has gliders that behave like moving objects with conservation laws). Wolfram in 2002 speculated the universe could be a CA. SEP likely extends this idea with recursion (perhaps the rules themselves can change based on outcomes, making it more powerful than a fixed CA).
* **Konrad Zuse’s Rechnender Raum (Computing Cosmos)**: In 1967, Zuse proposed that the physical universe is being computed on a discrete lattice (a cellular automaton essentially). This was an early digital ontology.
* **John von Neumann’s Universal Constructor**: which was a self-replicating automaton. Not directly our aim, but it shows how computation can emulate life-like behavior.
* **Quantum Simulation**: Feynman suggested that to simulate quantum physics, one needs a quantum computer. Perhaps SEP could incorporate quantum computing principles (like qubits instead of bits), to more naturally embed quantum behavior.

The distinctive thing about SEP from what the snippet suggests is the *prime-based* aspect. “Prime-Based Recursive Framework” hints that prime numbers might be fundamental in how the system encodes identity. Why primes? Primes are unique building blocks of integers (via prime factorization). If one needed to give each “entity” a unique identity, a prime number can be that – because the product of primes can encode a combination of entities (a classic idea: use prime factors to assign unique interactions). For example, one might imagine each fundamental “atom” of this toy universe has a prime ID, and when they interact, their IDs combine multiplicatively. The combined product carries the information of which primes (which identities) participated (since the product’s factorization is unique). This is speculative, but perhaps that’s a mechanism to allow *reversible combination* and separation of information – a bit like how relatively prime frequencies in music produce unique combined waveform but can be decomposed via Fourier analysis.

In a “phase alignment” context, Euler’s insight on complex exponentials might be relevant: Euler showed $e^{i\theta}$ relates to sine and cosine (phases). If identity is encoded in phases (maybe via complex numbers representing states) and primes relate to base frequencies, then aligning phases recursively could produce resonance (coherence) which might correlate to energy minima or stable particles (“Energy emerges from recursive phase misalignment” says the snippet, which suggests when phases don’t align, their interference yields what we call energy).

We see an echo of this in wave mechanics: stable resonance (all phases aligned each cycle) is a minimal energy mode, whereas if you misalign phases, waves beat and create intensity variations – possibly interpreted as energy fluctuations.

**6.2 Architecture of SEP:** Although we don’t have a blueprint given, we can surmise:

* There is a state space, likely very high-dimensional or infinite (like an array of cells, or a graph).
* Each element of state can be something like an integer or bitstring that can carry prime factors or phase info.
* There is a recursive update rule. Possibly something like: at each step, each unit updates based on some function of its current state and the state of neighbors, *and maybe some global condition or cumulative variable (hence recursion beyond local?)*. However, purely global recursion could violate locality; maybe recursion is multi-scale: small loops for local interactions, larger loops for global consistency (like a hierarchy).
* “Phase alignment in infinite-dimensional quantum info systems” was mentioned, hinting SEP might use an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space concept (like perhaps each cell’s state is a complex vector of infinite dimension, or the overall state is something like a tensor network).
* The Ethical License snippet (though not about technicalities) shows Nagy intends SEP to be open and widely used – so it might be implemented in software or even hardware, for researchers to experiment.

One could imagine SEP initially as a computer program (maybe something like a large-scale cellular automaton with a twist). Over time, as patterns emerge, you’d analyze if those patterns obey laws analogous to physics. For example, do the moving patterns carry a “mass” (resistance to acceleration)? Do they attract each other like gravity or via information binding? Do they form composite structures? Does something like measurement occur (maybe an analog is a soliton colliding with another and leaving a stable outcome like either passing through or bouncing off – what’s the “observation” analog? Possibly not direct).

**6.3 Testing the Proposals:** With SEP, each of the proposals from earlier sections can be put to test in a simplified world:

* *Section 1 (Spacetime paths)*: See if the computational space of SEP can be interpreted as a metric space and if the system explores multiple paths. If SEP is deterministic, we might implement nondeterminism by random or by splitting the state (if we simulate many instances in parallel like a branching tree of simulations).
* *Section 2 (Mass/field analogies)*: Introduce something in SEP that corresponds to field flow. For instance, if each cell’s state influences neighbors, a moving particle might create a flow pattern. Measure whether that pattern exhibits drag or other analogies to inertia.
* *Section 3 (Measurement)*: Perhaps implement an “observer” subsystem in SEP (some complex of cells) and see if when it interacts with another subsystem (the “observed”), the result is an entangled state that yields decohered branches. If SEP is classical, this is tricky; if we allow quantum rules (like qubits and quantum gates), we could entangle parts and see Many-Worlds branching in the simulation. Alternatively, treat some subsystems probabilistically.
* *Section 4 (Recursion/Coherence)*: By construction, SEP is recursive – so we can observe whether it produces increasing coherence. One might measure an order parameter (like overall mutual information among parts, or the emergence of non-random structure).
* *Section 5 (Phase transitions)*: The simulation might have its own analog of a Big Bang – e.g., if started from a random initial state, does it undergo a sudden change where a structured universe “condenses” out? One could try different initial conditions: either a completely unordered one (max uncertainty) or a highly ordered one, and see if something interesting spontaneously breaks symmetry. Another test: does the simulation avoid states akin to singularities (like undefined or divergent values)? Ideally yes, if well-defined.

**6.4 Connections to Other Computational Models:** It’s worth noting that many have attempted something along these lines. For example, **Emergent Universe models** using cellular automata or lattice computations (some were inspired by Wolfram’s NKS). There’s also **quantum cellular automata** studied as potential fundamental frameworks (these are unitary updates on a grid of qubits, which can reproduce Dirac equation, etc.). SEP could draw from those – it might be a quantum cellular automaton with a twist of recursive rule adjustment.

One might ask, what is new in SEP? Possibly the novelty is the emphasis on *self-reference*: maybe the processing rules themselves look at the whole or at large-scale patterns (not purely local). That’s unusual because it breaks typical locality, but maybe in an emergent sense, not an explicit one. For instance, identity as inverse recursive reference – could mean an entity is defined by how it references (or interacts with) others and itself through multiple levels. Implementation-wise, this could be something like each object carries a code that is computed by iteratively mixing inputs including its own code – eventually stabilizing to a fixed identifier that distinguishes it (like a hashing algorithm run to fixed point).

Given the speculative nature, we can at least articulate how SEP might unify ideas:

* **Unification of GR and QM**: If SEP can show analogies of both gravitational (geometric, long-range binding) and quantum (superposition, entanglement) phenomena emerging from one information process, that’s a conceptual unification. It might provide insight if such unification in the sim leads to behaviors akin to known physics (like maybe it naturally respects a computational analog of relativity or uncertainty principle).
* **Open problems**: The measurement problem could be explored within SEP’s environment, as noted. Also, the question of why spacetime is 3+1 dimensions, or why quantum probabilities follow Born’s rule, etc., might be experimented with by altering SEP’s rules.
* **Entropy and arrow of time**: Does SEP produce an “arrow of time” (irreversibility) spontaneously? Many cellular automata are reversible, but when coarse-grained they show entropy increase. Observing that would link to Second Law emergence.

**6.5 Towards a Theory of SEP:** Ultimately, beyond a simulation, one wants analytical understanding. Perhaps one can derive equations for emergent quantities in SEP, similar to how hydrodynamics is derived from molecular dynamics. If SEP is well-defined enough, we might derive continuum equations in a limit that correspond to Einstein equations or Schrödinger equation, etc. That would be a huge win: an existence proof by construction that our physics can come from a deeper computation.

In summary, the Self-Emergent Processor is both a *philosophical model* – treating the universe as a computer that computes itself – and a *practical toolkit* to test emergent phenomena. It embodies the spirit of **experimentation** in silico for fundamental physics.

Nagy’s ethical licensing of SEP suggests he sees it as an open collaborative project, hinting that perhaps prototypes of SEP exist or are being developed. As such, in addition to theoretical exploration, SEP could become a playground for researchers from different fields (physics, computer science, complexity, philosophy) to come together and watch a mini-universe evolve, much like a vastly more complex Game of Life.

One could illustrate a network of nodes (like a graph) with arrows indicating recursive information flow (perhaps loops). Maybe show that each node contains a number (maybe prime factors) and interacts with neighbors. Also perhaps a small “time evolution” series: initial random state -> intermediate emergent patterns -> later complex structures. If possible, a screenshot-like image from a simulation could be shown (like a complex CA pattern).)*

## Conclusion

We have expanded Alexander J Nagy’s theoretical outline into a comprehensive framework suggesting that reality – from the fabric of spacetime to the particles and laws within it – can be understood as an emergent phenomenon of a recursive information process. In this view, the universe effectively computes itself into existence: **existence is algorithmic, and laws are fixed points of a cosmic computation**.

**Summary of Key Points:**

* **Spacetime and Causality:** Rather than a static stage or a singular history, spacetime is seen as a manifold encompassing a superposition of all physically possible paths. This aligns with the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and points toward a “many-worlds” or branching block-universe picture. The geometric structure of reality thus encodes an ensemble of potential trajectories, and what we call a physical event is a convergence of many possible histories into an observed outcome. This provides a novel way to reconcile the deterministic geometry of GR with the probabilistic spreads of QM – they coexist in a higher informational structure.

* **Mass and Inertia:** We reinterpreted mass as an emergent property of field interactions, comparable to the drag on an object moving through a fluid. This laminar flow analogy offers intuitive insight into inertia and gravitation: a mass “displaces” the spacetime-information medium, and resistance (inertia) is just the medium’s response to being disturbed. Gravitation, in turn, is the cumulative effect of these distortions drawing masses together – reminiscent of how pressure gradients pull fluid flow or how entangled information binds subsystems. Although qualitative, this picture is consistent with the Higgs mechanism’s idea of a field imparting mass and with general relativity’s frame-dragging effects (spacetime behaving like a viscous medium around rotating masses).

* **Quantum Measurement:** We addressed the measurement problem by suggesting that a measurement corresponds to the system’s self-referential stabilization of one branch of its state. The act of observation is a recursive interaction that yields a self-consistent record (the observer’s experience) and thereby “collapses” the indeterminate global state into a definite local reality. This is essentially an emergent collapse model: no new physics (like wavefunction collapse postulate) is invoked; instead, the branching of the wavefunction and subsequent decoherence naturally produce an observer-specific reality. Each observation is the universe telling one of its self-consistent stories – many stories exist in superposition, but each observer only hears one. Thus, classical objectivity and definite outcomes arise from the quantum substrate via recursion and environmental feedback.

* **Information and Recursion:** We embraced Wheeler’s “it from bit” hypothesis fully, positing that information (in the form of uncertainty or entropy) is the substance of the universe. Physical laws then appear as constraints or patterns in information that are preserved over recursive updates. Recursion – iterative self-interaction – is what drives random bits toward organized patterns (coherence). This can be seen as the source of **correlations and order** in the universe. Over cosmic history, as the universe recursively evolves, local uncertainties get correlated (via forces, interactions), creating structured complexity from an initial simplicity or randomness. Our framework even conjectures that information plays a gravitational role, cohering “identity units” together – an idea echoed by recent quantum gravity insights that entanglement (information) can generate geometric connectivity.

* **Cosmology – Big Bang as Transition:** We advocated that the origin of our observable universe should not be considered an ex nihilo singularity but rather a physical event – a phase transition – in a larger or prior system. This reframing allows the use of thermodynamics and quantum theory to understand the birth of the universe. It opens the door to cyclic models or multiverse scenarios where our Big Bang is just one of many, or one oscillation in an eternal series. By treating $t=0$ as a transitional phase, we avoid the infinities of classical theory and instead ask what critical phenomenon occurred – be it a bounce from collapse, a symmetry breaking of spacetime, or a vacuum decay. This embeds the universe’s beginning within the lawful realm of physics, aligning with the overall theme that the universe is self-generated (the ultimate recursion: the universe perhaps “creates” itself via laws that allow it to emerge from a prior state).

* **Self-Emergent Processor:** Finally, we translated these theoretical notions into a blueprint for a computational realization. The Self-Emergent Processor would be a sandbox where bits of information interact recursively to simulate a cosmos. Its design, possibly leveraging prime number identities and phase synchronization, would attempt to show how complexity and “laws” crystallize out of simple rules. If successful, SEP would serve as a proof-of-concept that a reality with its own version of “particles” and “forces” can spontaneously arise in a computer – strengthening the case that our reality could likewise be an outcome of deeper informational rules. At minimum, it would provide intuition and qualitative models: for example, we might see analogues of time’s arrow, of objects maintaining identity through recursive updates, of disturbances propagating like particles, etc., within such a simulation.

**Implications:** The recursive emergent reality framework is admittedly speculative and on the frontier between physics and philosophy of information. However, its implications are profound:

* It suggests a path to unify physics by seeking principles of **self-organization** and **information processing** that underlie quantum fields and spacetime geometry both. Instead of quantizing gravity in the usual sense, we might seek a common algorithm that yields both gravity and quantum behavior as emergent limits.
* It reframes unanswered questions (e.g., “Why is there something rather than nothing?”) as possibly misguided – instead, one asks how the most minimal something (perhaps just bits in void) could bootstrap itself into the rich structure we see. Existence could be seen as an inevitability of self-referential logic: truly nothingness might be an unstable solution to the cosmic recursion, and anything that can consistently refer to itself (even abstract information) will generate a universe.
* If information is fundamental, it also bridges to other fields: computational complexity, for instance, could limit what physical processes are possible. The holographic principle already hints at fundamental information bounds (like maximum entropy in a volume). Our approach would encourage looking at physical law through the lens of information processing efficiency or algorithmic complexity.
* There is a natural link to consciousness and observers. In a participatory universe, observers are part of the system’s recursive self-perception. While our focus was physical, one could extrapolate that mind and reality co-emerge if the brain or observer is part of that recursion. This dovetails with relational quantum mechanics and some interpretations where consciousness doesn’t mystically collapse the wavefunction but is simply another emergent process that witnesses one branch. It invites interdisciplinary exploration into complex systems, life, and cognition as emergent from information dynamics.

**Challenges:** We must also acknowledge challenges and criticisms:

* The framework is broad and not yet expressed as a single concise theory or equation, making it hard to falsify or test directly. We’ve cited support from various established ideas, but the **integration** of them remains hypothetical.
* It from bit, while elegant, raises the question: **Whose bit?** Information is usually defined relative to observers or systems. If before observers exist the universe is just information, one needs a self-contained definition of information (perhaps algorithmic or Shannon information of the state). We assume an objective information content in the universe, which is a subtle philosophical point.
* The SEP approach might end up like a TOE (Theory of Everything) that is so flexible it can be tuned to produce anything and thus predicts nothing in particular. Avoiding that requires pinning down specific mechanisms (for example, the prime recursion idea) and deriving concrete consequences (maybe a unique signature in cosmic structure or particle spectrum).
* There is also the matter of scale: emergent phenomena often require many degrees of freedom. Our everyday world emerges from $10^{23}$ particles’ interactions. So to get spacetime and particles emergent, the “bits” beneath them might be incredibly numerous (like Planck-scale cells). This can make the approach impractical to simulate fully or to use directly for calculations. The hope is to identify effective laws that describe the emergence without tracking zillions of bits individually.

**Outlook:** In spite of challenges, the rewards of pursuing this framework could be high. It offers a **unifying narrative** that ties together:

* The success of quantum information theory in describing black hole entropy and perhaps spacetime (ER=EPR).
* The success of computational modeling in capturing complex emergent behaviors in many-body systems.
* The age-old philosophical desire to find a first principle (like a logical or mathematical necessity) for why the universe is the way it is.

Moreover, technology is at a point where these ideas can be explored. Quantum computing and advanced simulations may allow us to toy with “universe-like” cellular automata or quantum networks. If an SEP-like model even qualitatively reproduces features of our physics, it would be a landmark demonstration of emergence.

In concluding, we echo Wheeler: *“Reality may not be wholly physical; in some sense, our cosmos must be a participatory self-synthesis of information.”* The recursive framework takes this seriously, depicting a universe that writes its own laws through the feedback of existence. While much work remains to formalize and validate this vision, it charts a fascinating research direction. By reinterpreting spacetime, matter, and causality in terms of information and computation, we open possibilities of finally resolving the paradoxes of quantum mechanics and gravity – not by changing the equations, but by changing how we think about what those equations **mean**. The “code” of reality could be iterating just beneath our perception, and with careful thought and experiment, we might one day read (or even rewrite) that code.
