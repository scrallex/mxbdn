# Strategic Pillar 2: Scientific Visualization & Research Market

This document outlines a professional spin-off of the SEP Engine focused on the scientific visualization and research community.

## Product: SEP Engine

An open-source framework written in C++ with a modular, GPU-accelerated core. The engine supports complex system simulation and offers optional commercial support and consulting services. A paid "Pro" edition may provide specialized tooling and long-term maintenance.

## Value Proposition

A high-performance framework for simulating emergent phenomena. Researchers can leverage the modular design and CUDA backend to model everything from material science to cosmological processes.

## Target Market

- University research labs (physics, computer science, complexity science)
- Data visualization companies
- R&D groups in technology firms

## Marketing Focus

- Emphasize the robust architecture and well-documented modules
- Showcase GPU acceleration via the CUDA backend
- Publish `THESIS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` as whitepapers for outreach
